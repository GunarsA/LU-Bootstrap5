                Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is
                lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose
                implementations allow client-side script to interact with the
                user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming
                language with object-oriented capabilities.

                JavaScript was first known as
                <strong>LiveScript</strong>, but Netscape changed its name to
                JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated
                by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in
                1995 with the name <strong>LiveScript</strong>. The
                general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in
                Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

                Client-Side JavaScript
              </header>
              <section>
                <p>
                  Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the
                  language. The script should be included in or referenced by an
                  HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can
                  include programs that interact with the user, control the
                  browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages
                  over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you
                  might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid
                  e-mail address in a form field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the
                  form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be
                  submitted to the Web Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                  JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as
                  button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the
                  user initiates explicitly or implicitly.

              </header>
              <section>
                <p>The merits of using JavaScript are:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Less server interaction</strong> <br />
                  You can validate user input before sending the page off to the
                  server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on
                  your server.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Immediate feedback to the visitors</strong> <br />
                  They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have
                  forgotten to enter something.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Increased interactivity</strong> <br />
                  You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over
                  them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Richer interfaces</strong> <br />
                  You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-anddrop
                  components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site
                  visitors.

                Limitations of JavaScript

              <section>
                <p>
                  We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming
                  language. It lacks the following important features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing
                    of files. This has been kept for security reason.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications
                    because there is no such support available.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor
                    capabilities.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted
                  programming language that allows you to build interactivity
                  into otherwise static HTML pages.

              <section>
                <p>
                  One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not
                  require expensive development tools. You can start with a
                  simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted
                  language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even
                  need to buy a compiler.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with
                  very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed
                  here:

                  The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to
                  be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to
                  Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference
                  between the two is extremely minor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the
                  following site: <a href="#">http://www.ecmascript.org</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform
                  to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still
                  support the features that are not a part of the standard.

                <p>
                  In the context of this book, the most important HTML tag is
                  <code>&#60;script&#62;</code>. This tag allows us to include a
                  piece of JavaScript in a document.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code>
                    &lt;h1&gt;Testing alert&lt;/h1&gt; <br />
                    &lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;hello!&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;
                  </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such a script will run as soon as its
                  <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is encountered while the
                  browser reads the HTML. This page will pop up a dialog when
                  opened&mdash;the <code>alert</code> function resembles prompt,
                  in that it pops up a little window, but only shows a message
                  without asking for input.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Including large programs directly in HTML documents is often
                  impractical. The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag can be given
                  an src attribute to fetch a script file (a text file
                  containing a JavaScript program) from a URL.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code>
                    &lt;h1&gt;Testing alert&lt;/h1&gt; <br />
                    &lt;script src=&quot;code/hello.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                  </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>code/hello.js</em> file included here contains the
                  same program&mdash;<code>alert(&quot;hello!&quot;)</code>.
                  When an HTML page references other URLs as part of
                  itself&mdash;for example, an image file or a script&mdash;web
                  browsers will retrieve them immediately and include them in
                  the page.
