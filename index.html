            Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is
            lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose
            implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user
            and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language
            with object-oriented capabilities.

            JavaScript was first known as
            <span class="fw-bold">LiveScript</span>, but Netscape changed its
            name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being
            generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape
            2.0 in 1995 with the name <span class="fw-bold">LiveScript</span>.
            The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in
            Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

          <section>
            <p>
              Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language.
              The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document
              for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can
              include programs that interact with the user, control the browser,
              and dynamically create HTML content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over
              traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use
              JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address
              in a form field.
            </p>
            <p>
              The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form,
              and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to
              the Web Server.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as
              button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user
              initiates explicitly or implicitly.
