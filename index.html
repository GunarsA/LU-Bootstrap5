            Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is
            lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose
            implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user
            and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language
            with object-oriented capabilities.

            JavaScript was first known as
            <strong>LiveScript</strong>, but Netscape changed its name to
            JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by
            Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995
            with the name <strong>LiveScript</strong>. The general-purpose
            core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet
            Explorer, and other web browsers.

          <h2 class="border-bottom py-3">Client-Side JavaScript</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language.
              The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML
              document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can
              include programs that interact with the user, control the
              browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages
              over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might
              use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail
              address in a form field.
            </p>
            <p>
              The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form,
              and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted
              to the Web Server.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as
              button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user
              initiates explicitly or implicitly.

          <h2 class="border-bottom py-3">Advantages of JavaScript</h2>
          <div>
            <p>The merits of using JavaScript are:</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Less server interaction</strong> <br>
              You can validate user input before sending the page off to the
              server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your
              server.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Immediate feedback to the visitors</strong> <br>
              They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have
              forgotten to enter something.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Increased interactivity</strong> <br>
              You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over
              them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Richer interfaces</strong> <br>
              You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-anddrop
              components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site
              visitors.

          <h2 class="border-bottom py-3">Limitations of JavaScript</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming
              language. It lacks the following important features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing
                of files. This has been kept for security reason.
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because
                there is no such support available.
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor
                capabilities.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming
              language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise
              static HTML pages.

          <div>
            <p>
              One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require
              expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text
              editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language
              inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy
              a compiler.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very
              nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here:

                Microsoft FrontPage: Microsoft has developed a popular HTML
                editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides web
                developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the
                creation of interactive websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                Macromedia Dreamweaver MX: Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very
                popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional web
                development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt
                JavaScript components, integrates well with databases, and
                conforms to new standards such as XHTML and XML.
              </li>
              <li>
                Macromedia HomeSite 5: HomeSite 5 is a well-liked HTML and
                JavaScript editor from Macromedia that can be used to manage
                personal websites effectively.

          <div>
            <p>
              The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be
              released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition
              5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two
              is extremely minor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the
              following site:
              <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org">http://www.ecmascript.org</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to
              the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still
              support the features that are not a part of the standard.

          <div>
            <p>
              In the context of this book, the most important HTML tag is
              <code>&#60;script&#62;</code>. This tag allows us to include a
              piece of JavaScript in a document.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                  &lt;h1&gt;Testing alert&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                  &lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;hello!&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Such a script will run as soon as its
              <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is encountered while the browser
              reads the HTML. This page will pop up a dialog when
              opened&mdash;the <code>alert</code> function resembles prompt,
              in that it pops up a little window, but only shows a message
              without asking for input.
            </p>
            <p>
              Including large programs directly in HTML documents is often
              impractical. The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag can be given an
              src attribute to fetch a script file (a text file containing a
              JavaScript program) from a URL.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                  &lt;h1&gt;Testing alert&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                  &lt;script src=&quot;code/hello.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>code/hello.js</em> file included here contains the same
              program&mdash;<code>alert(&quot;hello!&quot;)</code>. When an
              HTML page references other URLs as part of itself&mdash;for
              example, an image file or a script&mdash;web browsers will
              retrieve them immediately and include them in the page.
